B Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. C Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use in pregnant women despite potential risks. D There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use in pregnant women despite potential risks. X Studies in animals or humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities and/or there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience, and the risks involved in use in pregnant women clearly outweigh potential benefits.

Disease: Hypertension - High Blood Pressure (Hypertension) Other names: Drug-Induced Hypertension High blood pressure is a term that is used to acknowledge that a person\\u2019s blood pressure is above what is considered normal. High blood pressure is also called hypertension. Measuring somebody's blood pressure gives us an indication of how effectively their heart is working to pump blood around their body. If their heart and blood vessels are working efficiently, then their blood pressure will be normal or slightly below normal. If their heart is having to work very hard to pump blood around their body, then their blood pressure will be high. Blood pressure is composed of two measurements. The first recording is called the systolic pressure and it measures the force the heart must pump against to get blood to flow around the body. It can indicate how flexible or stiff the blood vessels are. During this measurement, the blood pressure cuff inflates to a certain extent and records what pressure around the arm stops blood flow. The second recording is called diastolic pressure. This measures the resting pressure when the heart relaxes between heartbeats. It is recorded while the blood pressure cuff is deflating. Most experts consider a normal blood pressure to be 120/80 mm Hg. Ideally, everybody\\u2019s blood pressure should be below 130/80 mm Hg. If the first number is above 130 or the second number is above 80 then a person is said to have high blood pressure. What are the symptoms of high blood pressure? Most people experience no symptoms when their blood pressure is high. Sometimes people may develop a headache or feel unwell; however, most do not connect these vague symptoms as having to do with their heart. If high blood pressure is left untreated, it can damage the blood vessels and increase a person\\u2019s risk of having a stroke or a heart attack. It also causes the heart to enlarge and weaken because it essentially wears itself out from having to work so hard to push blood around the body. People with high blood pressure are also more likely to develop high cholesterol, kidney and eye problems, and have poor circulation in the legs and feet. How is High Blood Pressure Diagnosed? It is not uncommon for your blood pressure to go high occasionally; however, it is persistently high blood pressure that is a concern. For this reason, if a doctor or nurse takes your blood pressure and it is high but you don\\u2019t have any risk factors or symptoms, then at least two other separate measurements should be taken before you are diagnosed with high blood pressure. Before getting your blood pressure taken you should avoid the following for at least an hour before the measurement: Strenuous exercise Smoking Caffeine Eating Stressful situations. Sit down for at least five minutes before the reading is taken and don\\u2019t talk while it is being measured. Other tests may be ordered if your doctor concludes you have high blood pressure. These may include blood tests, an electrocardiogram, and sometimes a chest x-ray. How is High Blood Pressure Treated? Treatment depends on how high your blood pressure is. For people whose systolic reading falls in the range 120 to 129 and the diastolic reading is equal to or less than 80, lifestyle changes are usually recommended over medications. These may include: Losing weight if you are overweight Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables Eating less salt Eating less saturated fats Increased physical activity More physical activity Limiting alcohol. If treatment is considered necessary, sometimes more than one medication is prescribed. high blood pressure include: Diuretics Beta-blockers ACE inhibitors Angiotensin-receptor blockers Calcium channel blockers Alpha-blockers..
